Script Purpose:

The main purpose of the Portfolio script is to show the percentage I have in each asset allocation class--   large value, small growth, etc.  Low percentages will show me which classes I should invest in next to help balance out my portfolio.  This is assuming these lower-percentage investments have done well overall.
